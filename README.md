## How to manage this dot-vimrc?
All plugins are listed in `bundles.vim` with detailed comments, just add plugins as you like.

1. `:PluginClean` to clean up unused plugins
2. `:PluginInstall` to install newly added plugins
3. `:PluginUpdate` to upgrade all plugins

Other configurations are also well organized in vimrc.

If you want to synchronize with my configuration, just run `install.sh` again.

Happy coding with Vim!
